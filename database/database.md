> An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.

### Sequelize:

> Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM(object relational mapping)tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift and Snowflakeâ€™s Data Cloud. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

* ORM(object relational mapping) => sql , postgres, sqllite => Ms sql => mysql
* ODM (object data model) => mongodb =>  Amazon 


``npm i pg sequelize``

### pg - node-postgres

> node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, streaming results, C/C++ bindings, rich type parsing, and more!

```javascript
//models - index.js
'use strict'

const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const people = require('./people.model.js');

//prepare the connection
const POSTGRES_URL = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

let sequelizeOptions = {};

let sequelize = new Sequelize(POSTGRES_URL,{});

module.exports = {
    db: sequelize,//for real connection and will use it in index.js
    People: people(sequelize, DataTypes)// for creating the table and will use it in our route
}

//people.model.js
'use strict'

const People = (sequelize, DataTypes) => sequelize.define('people', {
    firstName: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
    },
    lastName: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
    }
})

module.exports = People
```
